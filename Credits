----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unfortunately making sure full credits were kept track of wasn't a priority,
this list will be updated over time to include specific credits as I find them.

the ORIGINAL CREDITS.rtf file is from the original version of Gerudoku,
it includes credits for textures that have been removed either because they were unused or because the use of a texture was no longer allowed.
