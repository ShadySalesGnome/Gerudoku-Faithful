# Gerudoku-Faithful
A Faithful Continuation of the Gerudoku texture pack.


**About**:
------------
This pack is a faithful continuation of the Gerudoku texture pack (by Tom Bones/Ganonline),
which was a mix of textures from Doku's RPG, Dustycraft, and many more (Credits included in zip file),
nearly 12 years ago I was inspired to continue it by other continuations and remixes of Gerudoku,
I've tried to keep as many of the original textures as possible and maintain the style with anything new added over the years.

**Tyken132** (creator of Tydoku) contacted many of the old texture artists to collaborate on Gerudoku Genesis,
it is through this collaboration that Gerudoku Faithful is now maintained.

**Links and Other Information**

I recommend **Optifine** for full functionality of the pack.
For Fabric I'd recommend the **Fabulously Optimized** modpack for ease of use, or https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives/ for a list of Optifine alternatives

Alternate Textures can be found in the links section on the Minecraft Forums post

------------------------------

Permission to use textures were mostly given on a case by case basis or as a blanket rule by the individual texture artists, 
an example of one such blanket rule can be found on https://www.johnsmithlegacy.co.uk
and another example can be found on Tom Bones Minecraft Forum Account Bio

Unfortunately finding everyone who ever contributed to the pack is nearly impossible now as after the 12 years since I began, many have left the Minecraft community behind, I cannot give anyone permission to use anything I did not make.
